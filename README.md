# BlockyUI

I developed this NUI-based menu library a few years ago, meant as a
predecesor to [NeoUI](https://github.com/DevBlocky/neo-ui), and just
got around to polishing and releasing it. Although it doesn't have
any documentation aside from `example.lua`, it's almost completely
done. I might flesh this out a bit more, depending on my availability.
